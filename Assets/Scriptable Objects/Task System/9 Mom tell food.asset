  descriptionText: Hi son,<br>      Look at you! You have made so much progress in
    such a short time!<br>      Let me teach you how to process food! Everything
    is so simple in our stone age, some food need to be boiled before putting into
    a drink, some need to combine a few together into a larger cube, and some need
    to be ground and sliced! Go experiment and make me some berry jam and lemon slice<br>                                                 
    Remember to always have fun!<br>
