  descriptionText: "Hey son,<br>      Good job, you got them! Oh wait, what, you
    said Boba Shop not Baba Shop... Ah! I feel so embarrassed.<br>      I see you\u2019ve
    gotten the large stones! On your crafting table, try to combine three large stones
    side by side, you would craft a grounding table that allow you to ground or sharpen
    these stones and unlock infinite possibilities!<br>                                                             
    Good Luck,<br>                                                              --
