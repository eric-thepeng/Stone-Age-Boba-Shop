  descriptionText: "Hi son,<br>      Good job! Now, building a shop from scratch
    take a lot of efforts. You need to have at least three products, which means
    designing three unique types of Boba drink recipes. You\u2019ll also need to
    build a table and a chair for customers to use, and the final piece of the picture:
    a dress uniform! It makes your shop looks so much more professional!<br>     
    Keep working on building them, and I\u2019m sure the day your shop opens, it
    would be a great hit!<br>                                                             
    Good Luck!<br>                                                              --
