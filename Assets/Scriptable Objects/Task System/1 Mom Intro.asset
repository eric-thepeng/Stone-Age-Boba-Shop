  descriptionText: "Hi son,<br>      Good job! Building a shop from scratch take
    a lot of efforts. Just to give you an overview, you need to design at least 4
    unique types of Boba drinks. You\u2019ll also need to build 1 table and 2 chairs
    for customers. Finally, the last piece of the picture: 1 skirt uniform! It makes
    your shop looks so much more professional!<br>      Keep working on building
    them, and I\u2019m sure the day your shop opens, it would be a great hit!<br>                                                             
    Good Luck!<br>                                                              --
    Mom"
