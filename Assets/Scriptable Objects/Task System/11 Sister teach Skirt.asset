  descriptionText: "Good job lil bro,<br>      You were asking me the other day how
    to make a skirt as the shop uniform right! A bit complicated, are you ready?
    First you will need three piece of softened leather, as well as two bone needles
    threaded with grass strings.<br>      Then, weave the three pieces of leathers
    together with the needles in between, and VOILA!<br>      Phew, don\u2019t tell
    me you can\u2019t handle needle works.<br>                                                        
    -- Always the best, Jessie"
